# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the final consolidation phase of the Spotify Playlist Mixer refactoring effort. After completing three major refactors (drag-drop-system-refactor, monolithic-file-refactor, and spotify-playlist-mixer-refactor), we need to consolidate duplicate components, implement comprehensive error handling, and create a complete unit testing suite. The primary focus is on eliminating code duplication between TrackItem and TrackListItem components, completing error handling implementation, and ensuring comprehensive test coverage across all refactored modules.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Component Consolidation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a single, reusable track component that can handle all track display scenarios, so that I can maintain consistent behavior and reduce code duplication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining TrackItem and TrackListItem components THEN the system SHALL identify overlapping functionality and consolidate into a single component
2. WHEN consolidating components THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing functionality from both components
3. WHEN using the consolidated component THEN it SHALL support both modal and draggable list contexts
4. WHEN refactoring is complete THEN there SHALL be no duplicate track rendering logic across the codebase
5. IF the consolidated component is used in different contexts THEN it SHALL adapt its behavior through props configuration

### Requirement 2: Comprehensive Error Handling Implementation

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to gracefully handle all error scenarios without crashing or getting stuck, so that I can continue using the mixer even when issues occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any component encounters an error THEN the system SHALL implement proper error boundaries to prevent crashes
2. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL provide user-friendly error messages and retry mechanisms
3. WHEN drag operations fail THEN the system SHALL automatically clean up state and provide recovery options
4. WHEN mixing operations encounter errors THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade and inform the user
5. IF memory leaks are detected THEN the system SHALL automatically clean up resources and log warnings
6. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed information for debugging while showing simple messages to users

### Requirement 3: Complete Unit Testing Suite

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive unit tests for all components and utilities, so that I can confidently make changes without breaking existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining test coverage THEN all components SHALL have unit tests with >90% code coverage
2. WHEN testing hooks THEN all custom hooks SHALL have comprehensive unit tests covering all scenarios
3. WHEN testing utilities THEN all utility functions SHALL have unit tests covering edge cases and error conditions
4. WHEN testing error handling THEN all error boundaries and recovery mechanisms SHALL have dedicated tests
5. WHEN testing drag operations THEN all drag-related functionality SHALL have tests covering mouse, touch, and keyboard interactions
6. IF integration scenarios exist THEN there SHALL be integration tests covering complete user workflows

### Requirement 4: Error Handling Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want error handling to be consistently applied across all components, so that the application maintains stability and provides consistent user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components are rendered THEN critical UI sections SHALL be wrapped with appropriate error boundaries
2. WHEN API operations are performed THEN they SHALL include proper error handling and user feedback
3. WHEN drag operations are active THEN error boundaries SHALL automatically clean up drag state on failures
4. WHEN routing changes occur THEN the system SHALL clean up any active operations and resources
5. IF errors are recoverable THEN the system SHALL attempt automatic recovery before showing error messages

### Requirement 5: Performance and Memory Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to perform efficiently without memory leaks or performance degradation, so that I can use it for extended periods without issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components unmount THEN all resources (timers, listeners, observers) SHALL be properly cleaned up
2. WHEN drag operations complete THEN all drag-related resources SHALL be released immediately
3. WHEN large playlists are processed THEN the system SHALL maintain responsive performance
4. WHEN memory usage grows THEN the system SHALL detect and warn about potential leaks
5. IF performance degrades THEN the system SHALL provide debugging information to identify bottlenecks

### Requirement 6: Code Quality and Maintainability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clean, well-documented code that follows consistent patterns, so that the codebase is maintainable and extensible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing code THEN all components SHALL follow consistent TypeScript patterns and naming conventions
2. WHEN examining error handling THEN it SHALL follow a consistent pattern across all components
3. WHEN looking at tests THEN they SHALL follow consistent testing patterns and naming conventions
4. WHEN reading code THEN complex logic SHALL be properly documented with JSDoc comments
5. IF new patterns are introduced THEN they SHALL be documented and consistently applied
