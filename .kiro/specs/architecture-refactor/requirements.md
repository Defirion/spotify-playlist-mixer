# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on refactoring the existing Spotify Playlist Mixer application to improve its architecture, maintainability, and scalability while preserving all current frontend functionality. The refactor will implement clean architecture principles, proper separation of concerns, and modern React patterns without changing the user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the codebase, I want a clean separation between business logic and UI components, so that I can easily test, modify, and extend functionality without affecting the presentation layer.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN business logic is extracted from components THEN all data processing, API calls, and state management logic SHALL be moved to dedicated service layers
2. WHEN components are refactored THEN they SHALL only handle presentation logic and user interactions
3. WHEN the refactor is complete THEN all existing functionality SHALL work identically to the current implementation
4. WHEN new features are added THEN they SHALL be implementable without modifying existing UI components

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer working with the Spotify API, I want a centralized and consistent API service layer, so that I can easily manage authentication, error handling, and API interactions across the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API calls are made THEN they SHALL go through a centralized Spotify service layer
2. WHEN authentication tokens are managed THEN they SHALL be handled by a dedicated authentication service
3. WHEN API errors occur THEN they SHALL be handled consistently across all API interactions
4. WHEN rate limiting is encountered THEN the system SHALL handle it gracefully with appropriate retry logic

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer managing application state, I want a predictable and centralized state management system, so that I can easily track data flow and debug state-related issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN application state is managed THEN it SHALL use a centralized state management pattern (Context API or similar)
2. WHEN state changes occur THEN they SHALL be predictable and traceable
3. WHEN components need state THEN they SHALL access it through well-defined interfaces
4. WHEN state updates happen THEN they SHALL not cause unnecessary re-renders

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer writing tests, I want loosely coupled and testable code, so that I can write comprehensive unit and integration tests for all business logic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN business logic is implemented THEN it SHALL be easily testable in isolation
2. WHEN services are created THEN they SHALL have clear interfaces and dependency injection
3. WHEN components are built THEN they SHALL be testable without complex mocking
4. WHEN the refactor is complete THEN test coverage SHALL be possible for all critical business logic

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer extending the application, I want a modular and extensible architecture, so that I can add new features without modifying existing code extensively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new playlist mixing strategies are added THEN they SHALL be implementable through a plugin-like interface
2. WHEN new data sources are integrated THEN they SHALL follow consistent patterns
3. WHEN new UI components are created THEN they SHALL integrate seamlessly with existing services
4. WHEN the architecture is extended THEN it SHALL maintain backward compatibility

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer debugging issues, I want proper error boundaries and error handling, so that I can quickly identify and resolve problems without affecting the entire application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur in components THEN they SHALL be caught by error boundaries
2. WHEN API errors happen THEN they SHALL be logged and handled appropriately
3. WHEN unexpected errors occur THEN the application SHALL degrade gracefully
4. WHEN debugging is needed THEN error messages SHALL provide sufficient context

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer working with complex data transformations, I want pure functions and immutable data patterns, so that I can reason about data flow and avoid side effects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is transformed THEN it SHALL use pure functions without side effects
2. WHEN state is updated THEN it SHALL follow immutable patterns
3. WHEN playlist mixing occurs THEN the algorithm SHALL be deterministic and testable
4. WHEN data flows through the system THEN it SHALL be traceable and predictable

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining performance, I want optimized rendering and efficient data handling, so that the application remains responsive even with large playlists.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components render THEN they SHALL only re-render when necessary
2. WHEN large datasets are processed THEN they SHALL be handled efficiently
3. WHEN expensive operations occur THEN they SHALL be memoized or cached appropriately
4. WHEN the application loads THEN it SHALL maintain current performance characteristics
