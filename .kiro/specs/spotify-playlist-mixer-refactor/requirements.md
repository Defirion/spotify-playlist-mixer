# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Spotify Playlist Mixer application currently suffers from architectural issues including code duplication, complex drag-and-drop logic, scattered API calls, performance problems with large playlists, and poor maintainability. This refactoring project aims to transform the existing 6.5/10 "spaghetti code" into a production-grade, maintainable, and performant application while preserving all existing functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Component Architecture Consolidation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consolidated and reusable components so that I can maintain the codebase efficiently without code duplication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the codebase THEN there SHALL be no redundant components like PlaylistPreview.js
2. WHEN examining modal components THEN AddUnselectedModal.js and SpotifySearchModal.js SHALL use shared, reusable Modal and TrackList components
3. WHEN looking at track rendering THEN there SHALL be a single, reusable TrackItem component used across all track displays
4. IF a component handles similar functionality THEN it SHALL be abstracted into a shared component or hook

### Requirement 2: Drag-and-Drop Logic Simplification

**User Story:** As a developer, I want simplified drag-and-drop logic so that I can easily maintain and debug the interactive features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing drag-and-drop THEN all D&D logic SHALL be encapsulated in a single useDraggable custom hook
2. WHEN examining DragContext.js THEN it SHALL only manage global dragging state without complex notification functions
3. WHEN reviewing touch handling THEN there SHALL be no duplicated touch logic across components
4. WHEN components need D&D functionality THEN they SHALL use the useDraggable hook instead of implementing their own logic

### Requirement 3: API Layer Abstraction

**User Story:** As a developer, I want centralized API management so that data fetching is consistent and maintainable across the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making Spotify API calls THEN all API logic SHALL be consolidated in src/utils/spotify.js
2. WHEN components need data THEN they SHALL use custom hooks like useSpotifySearch() instead of direct API calls
3. WHEN examining the codebase THEN there SHALL be no duplicated fetchAllPlaylistTracks functions
4. WHEN API calls are made THEN they SHALL include proper error handling and loading states

### Requirement 4: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want smooth performance with large playlists so that the application remains responsive regardless of playlist size.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying large track lists THEN the application SHALL use virtualization to render only visible items
2. WHEN examining performance THEN there SHALL be no inline styles that cause unnecessary re-renders
3. WHEN the playlist contains hundreds of tracks THEN the application SHALL maintain smooth scrolling and interaction
4. WHEN components re-render THEN they SHALL only re-render when necessary data changes

### Requirement 5: Styling and Responsiveness Standardization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent styling architecture so that the UI is maintainable and responsive across all devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining component code THEN there SHALL be no inline style objects
2. WHEN styling components THEN all styles SHALL be in CSS files with proper class names
3. WHEN handling responsiveness THEN the application SHALL use only CSS media queries, not JavaScript-based device detection
4. WHEN adding new styles THEN they SHALL follow a consistent methodology like CSS Modules

### Requirement 6: State Management Improvement

**User Story:** As a developer, I want organized state management so that application state is predictable and easy to debug.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining App.js THEN it SHALL not act as a "God component" with excessive state and prop drilling
2. WHEN managing related state THEN it SHALL use useReducer for complex state updates
3. WHEN state changes occur THEN they SHALL be predictable and follow established patterns
4. WHEN debugging state issues THEN the state structure SHALL be clear and well-organized

### Requirement 7: Accessibility Enhancement

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want keyboard-accessible drag-and-drop functionality so that I can reorder tracks without using a mouse.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN users SHALL be able to select tracks using the Spacebar
2. WHEN a track is selected THEN users SHALL be able to move it up or down using Arrow Keys
3. WHEN using screen readers THEN the drag-and-drop functionality SHALL be properly announced
4. WHEN interacting with the application THEN all interactive elements SHALL be keyboard accessible

### Requirement 8: Code Quality and Type Safety

**User Story:** As a developer, I want type safety and better code quality so that I can catch errors early and refactor with confidence.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing new code THEN it SHALL include proper TypeScript types
2. WHEN examining data structures THEN track and playlist objects SHALL have well-defined interfaces
3. WHEN refactoring THEN TypeScript SHALL catch potential runtime errors
4. WHEN developing THEN the IDE SHALL provide accurate autocompletion and error detection

### Requirement 9: Testing Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing so that refactoring doesn't break existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN refactoring components THEN there SHALL be unit tests to verify functionality
2. WHEN testing custom hooks THEN they SHALL have dedicated test suites
3. WHEN API functions are created THEN they SHALL be tested with mock data
4. WHEN running tests THEN they SHALL provide confidence that the refactoring preserves existing behavior

### Requirement 10: Development Experience Improvement

**User Story:** As a developer, I want improved development tooling so that I can work efficiently and catch issues early.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developing THEN there SHALL be proper ESLint configuration for code quality
2. WHEN committing code THEN there SHALL be pre-commit hooks to ensure code standards
3. WHEN building the application THEN there SHALL be no warnings or errors
4. WHEN debugging THEN the development tools SHALL provide clear error messages and stack traces
