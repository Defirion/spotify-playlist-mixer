# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The application contains several monolithic files that violate the single responsibility principle and make the codebase difficult to maintain, test, and understand. The primary offender is `src/utils/playlistMixer.ts`, which contains over 1000 lines of code handling multiple concerns including popularity calculations, track shuffling, quadrant creation, strategy-based selection, and the main mixing algorithm. This refactoring project aims to break down these monolithic files into smaller, focused modules that follow clean architecture principles and improve maintainability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Playlist Mixer Utility Decomposition

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the playlist mixer utility broken into focused modules so that I can easily understand, test, and maintain each piece of functionality independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the codebase THEN the `playlistMixer.ts` file SHALL be split into multiple focused modules
2. WHEN looking at popularity calculations THEN they SHALL be in a dedicated `popularityCalculator.ts` module
3. WHEN examining track shuffling logic THEN it SHALL be in a dedicated `trackShuffler.ts` module
4. WHEN reviewing quadrant creation THEN it SHALL be in a dedicated `popularityQuadrants.ts` module
5. WHEN looking at mixing strategies THEN they SHALL be in a dedicated `mixingStrategies.ts` module
6. WHEN examining the main mixing algorithm THEN it SHALL be in a focused `playlistMixer.ts` file that orchestrates the other modules

### Requirement 2: Clear Module Boundaries and Interfaces

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear interfaces between modules so that I can work on one module without affecting others and easily write unit tests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN modules interact THEN they SHALL use well-defined TypeScript interfaces
2. WHEN a module exports functions THEN each function SHALL have a single, clear responsibility
3. WHEN examining module dependencies THEN they SHALL follow a clear hierarchy with no circular dependencies
4. WHEN testing modules THEN each module SHALL be testable in isolation with mocked dependencies

### Requirement 3: Popularity Calculation Module

**User Story:** As a developer, I want popularity calculations isolated so that I can easily modify popularity algorithms without affecting other mixing logic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calculating track popularity THEN the `popularityCalculator.ts` module SHALL handle all popularity-related calculations
2. WHEN applying recency boosts THEN the calculation SHALL be encapsulated in a pure function
3. WHEN creating popularity quadrants THEN the logic SHALL be separated from the main mixing algorithm
4. WHEN debugging popularity issues THEN the module SHALL provide clear logging and debugging information

### Requirement 4: Track Shuffling and Utility Functions

**User Story:** As a developer, I want utility functions like shuffling and duration calculations in a dedicated module so that they can be reused and tested independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN shuffling tracks THEN the `trackShuffler.ts` module SHALL provide all shuffling algorithms
2. WHEN calculating durations THEN utility functions SHALL be in a dedicated utilities module
3. WHEN working with arrays THEN defensive programming utilities SHALL be centralized
4. WHEN other modules need utility functions THEN they SHALL import from dedicated utility modules

### Requirement 5: Strategy Pattern Implementation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want mixing strategies implemented as a proper strategy pattern so that I can easily add new strategies without modifying existing code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing mixing strategies THEN they SHALL follow the strategy pattern with a common interface
2. WHEN adding new strategies THEN it SHALL not require modifying existing strategy code
3. WHEN selecting tracks based on strategy THEN each strategy SHALL be in its own focused function
4. WHEN testing strategies THEN each strategy SHALL be testable independently

### Requirement 6: Main Mixer Orchestration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the main mixer to be a clean orchestrator so that I can easily understand the overall mixing flow and modify it without getting lost in implementation details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the main mixer THEN it SHALL primarily orchestrate calls to other modules
2. WHEN the mixer runs THEN it SHALL delegate specific tasks to appropriate specialized modules
3. WHEN debugging mixing issues THEN the main flow SHALL be easy to follow and understand
4. WHEN modifying mixing logic THEN changes SHALL be localized to specific modules

### Requirement 7: Comprehensive Testing Structure

**User Story:** As a developer, I want each module to have comprehensive tests so that I can refactor with confidence and catch regressions early.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN modules are created THEN each SHALL have dedicated unit tests
2. WHEN testing popularity calculations THEN tests SHALL cover edge cases and different scenarios
3. WHEN testing strategies THEN each strategy SHALL have comprehensive test coverage
4. WHEN running tests THEN they SHALL provide clear feedback about which specific functionality is broken

### Requirement 8: Backward Compatibility

**User Story:** As a user, I want the refactoring to maintain all existing functionality so that my playlists continue to mix exactly as they did before.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN all existing mixing functionality SHALL work identically
2. WHEN comparing before and after THEN the same inputs SHALL produce the same outputs
3. WHEN using different mixing strategies THEN they SHALL behave exactly as they did before
4. WHEN handling edge cases THEN the behavior SHALL remain unchanged

### Requirement 9: Performance Maintenance

**User Story:** As a user, I want the refactored code to maintain or improve performance so that large playlist mixing remains fast and responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN mixing large playlists THEN performance SHALL be equal to or better than the original implementation
2. WHEN modules are separated THEN there SHALL be no significant performance overhead from the modular structure
3. WHEN profiling the application THEN the refactored code SHALL not introduce performance bottlenecks
4. WHEN handling memory usage THEN the modular structure SHALL not increase memory consumption

### Requirement 10: Documentation and Code Quality

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear documentation and high code quality so that I can easily understand and maintain the refactored modules.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining modules THEN each SHALL have clear JSDoc documentation
2. WHEN reading function signatures THEN their purpose and parameters SHALL be self-documenting
3. WHEN looking at complex algorithms THEN they SHALL have inline comments explaining the logic
4. WHEN following coding standards THEN all modules SHALL adhere to the project's TypeScript and ESLint rules
