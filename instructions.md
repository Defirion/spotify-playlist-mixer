Based on a comprehensive review of your project's JavaScript and CSS files, here is a detailed refactoring plan to elevate it to production-grade quality. The suggestions are prioritized from high-impact changes to long-term improvements.

  High-Priority Refactoring: Core Architecture & Code Health

  These changes address the most critical issues regarding maintainability, stability, and code duplication.

   1. Consolidate Redundant Components:
       * Problem: The PlaylistPreview.js component is almost entirely redundant. It duplicates data fetching, state management, and rendering logic found in PlaylistMixer.js and DraggableTrackList.js.
       * Solution:
           * Remove the PlaylistPreview.js component entirely.
           * Integrate its functionality into PlaylistMixer.js. The "preview" should be a state within the mixer that, when active, renders the DraggableTrackList with the generated tracks. This will centralize the mixing logic and remove a major source of
             code duplication.

   2. Abstract and Reuse Modal & Track UI:
       * Problem: AddUnselectedModal.js and SpotifySearchModal.js share nearly identical code for the modal structure (backdrop, container, styling) and the track list rendering. This is a classic case of UI duplication.
       * Solution:
           * Create a generic, reusable Modal.js component that provides the shell (backdrop, container, header, footer, and close logic).
           * Create a reusable TrackList.js component for displaying lists of tracks, and a TrackItem.js for rendering individual tracks.
           * Refactor both AddUnselectedModal.js and SpotifySearchModal.js to use these new, leaner components, passing in only the content specific to each modal.

   3. Centralize and Simplify Drag-and-Drop Logic:
       * Problem: The drag-and-drop (D&D) implementation is overly complex and spread across four different files (DragContext.js, DraggableTrackList.js, and the two modal components). The touch handling logic, in particular, is duplicated and difficult to
         maintain.
       * Solution:
           * Create a custom hook, useDraggable.js, to encapsulate all D&D logic (mouse, touch, state management, long-press detection).
           * Simplify DragContext.js to only manage the global dragging state (e.g., isDragging, draggedItem), removing the complex notification functions.
           * Refactor DraggableTrackList.js and the modal components to use the new useDraggable hook, which will dramatically reduce their size and complexity.

   4. Abstract API Calls:
       * Problem: Spotify API calls using axios are scattered throughout multiple components, mixing data fetching logic with UI concerns. The fetchAllPlaylistTracks function is duplicated in three different files.
       * Solution:
           * Consolidate all API-related code into src/utils/spotify.js. Create specific, reusable functions for each API endpoint (e.g., searchSpotify, getPlaylistDetails, getUserProfile).
           * Create custom hooks that use these API functions to manage data fetching, loading, and error states (e.g., useSpotifySearch(query), useUserPlaylists()). Components will then use these hooks to get data, simplifying them significantly.

  Medium-Priority Refactoring: Performance & Styling

  These changes will improve the user experience, especially on mobile and with large playlists, and make the codebase easier to style and maintain.

   5. Eliminate Inline Styles and Standardize CSS:
       * Problem: There is excessive use of inline style={{...}} objects throughout the components. This hurts performance, clutters the JSX, and makes styling difficult to manage.
       * Solution:
           * Move all inline styles to the index.css file under specific, reusable class names.
           * For a more robust, production-grade solution, adopt a modern CSS methodology like CSS Modules (.module.css files) to scope styles directly to their components, preventing global namespace conflicts.

   6. Virtualize the Main Track List:
       * Problem: The DraggableTrackList renders every single track in the list. With a large playlist (hundreds or thousands of songs), this will cause severe performance degradation and may crash the browser.
       * Solution:
           * Integrate a virtualization library like react-window or react-virtualized. This will ensure that only the visible items are rendered in the DOM, providing a smooth experience regardless of playlist size.

   7. Improve Responsiveness and Remove JS-based Media Queries:
       * Problem: The app uses a mix of CSS media queries and JavaScript (const [isMobile, setIsMobile] = useState(window.innerWidth <= 480);) to handle responsiveness. This is inconsistent and adds unnecessary complexity and re-renders.
       * Solution:
           * Remove all JavaScript-based device detection.
           * Rely exclusively on CSS media queries in index.css for all responsive styling. This is the standard, most performant, and maintainable approach.

  Long-Term Improvements & Best Practices

   8. Refine State Management:
       * Problem: App.js acts as a "God component," holding all major state and passing it down through deep prop drilling.
       * Solution: While the DragContext is a good start, a more comprehensive state management strategy is needed.
           * Short-term: Combine related useState calls in App.js into a single useReducer hook for more organized and predictable state updates.
           * Long-term: For a production application of this complexity, adopt a dedicated state management library like Zustand (for simplicity) or Redux Toolkit (for scalability).

   9. Enhance Accessibility (A11y):
       * Problem: The custom drag-and-drop feature is not accessible to users who rely on keyboards or screen readers.
       * Solution: Implement a keyboard-accessible alternative for reordering items in the DraggableTrackList. This typically involves allowing users to select an item (e.g., with the Spacebar) and move it up or down with the Arrow Keys.

   10. Adopt TypeScript:
       * Problem: As a plain JavaScript project, the app lacks type safety, making it prone to runtime errors and harder to refactor with confidence.
       * Solution: Gradually migrate the codebase to TypeScript. This will provide static type checking, dramatically improve code quality and autocompletion, and make the complex data structures (like track and playlist objects) much easier and safer to
         work with.
