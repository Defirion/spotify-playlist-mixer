# Touch Drag Timing Fixes

## Issues Identified

Based on the console logs, several timing-related issues were causing drag failures:

1. **Double drag start attempts**: Two `startDrag` calls happening within 1ms of each other
2. **Component unmounting during drag**: Multiple components unmounting while drag was active
3. **Race conditions**: Touch drag system and global drag state not properly synchronized
4. **Short long press delay**: 250ms was too short for reliable touch detection
5. **Rapid touch events**: No debouncing for rapid successive touch starts

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Increased Long Press Delay
- Changed `longPressDelay` from 250ms to 400ms for more reliable touch detection
- This gives users more time to establish a stable touch before drag starts

### 2. Added Double Start Prevention
- Added `dragStartedRef` to track if drag has been initiated
- Prevents multiple drag starts from the same touch sequence
- Added logging to track timing and debug issues

### 3. Improved Error Handling
- Wrapped all callback invocations in try-catch blocks
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging timing issues
- Improved cleanup error handling

### 4. Enhanced State Coordination
- Added checks in `useDraggable` to prevent starting drag when already dragging
- Improved coordination between touch drag and global drag state
- Only end drag if actually dragging to prevent state inconsistencies

### 5. Added Touch Debouncing
- Added `lastTouchStartRef` to debounce rapid touch starts
- Ignores touch starts within 100ms of previous touch start
- Prevents double-tap issues and rapid event firing

### 6. Improved Cleanup Timing
- Changed `onDragEnd` callback from `setTimeout(..., 0)` to immediate execution
- Increased drag item cleanup delay from 10ms to 50ms for better reliability
- Added proper cleanup of all timing-related refs

### 7. Better Logging and Debugging
- Added comprehensive logging for touch events and timing
- Track touch duration and movement for debugging
- Log cleanup events and state transitions

## Key Changes Made

### `src/hooks/drag/useTouchDrag.ts`
- Increased `longPressDelay` to 400ms
- Added `dragStartedRef` and `lastTouchStartRef` for state tracking
- Added debouncing logic in `handleTouchStart`
- Improved error handling in all event handlers
- Enhanced cleanup function with better state management
- Added comprehensive logging throughout

### `src/hooks/useDraggable.ts`
- Added drag state checks before calling `startDrag()`
- Added protection against double starts in touch and keyboard drag handlers
- Only call `endDrag()` if actually dragging

## Expected Improvements

1. **Reduced double drag starts**: Debouncing and state tracking should prevent rapid successive starts
2. **Better touch reliability**: Longer press delay gives more time for stable touch detection
3. **Cleaner state management**: Proper coordination between local and global drag state
4. **Improved error recovery**: Better error handling prevents stuck drag states
5. **Enhanced debugging**: Comprehensive logging helps identify remaining issues

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test with various touch speeds and durations
2. Verify drag works reliably on different devices/browsers
3. Check that component unmounting during drag is handled gracefully
4. Ensure no memory leaks from timers or event listeners
5. Verify drag state is properly reset after failures

## Monitoring

Watch for these log messages to verify fixes:
- `[useTouchDrag] Long press successful, starting drag` - Successful drag starts
- `[useTouchDrag] Ignoring rapid touch start` - Debouncing working
- `[useDraggable] Attempted to start ... drag while already dragging` - Double start prevention
- `[useTouchDrag] Touch end` - Proper drag completion

The timing issues should be significantly reduced with these changes.
