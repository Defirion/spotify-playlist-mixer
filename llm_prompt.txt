You are an expert React/TypeScript developer. Your task is to resolve ESLint warnings about unused variables in `src/components/SpotifySearchModal.tsx`.

**Current State:**
*   ESLint warnings indicate that `startDrag` and `endDrag` (destructured from `useDrag()`) are assigned but never used.

**Action Plan:**

1.  **Remove Unused Variables:**
    *   Locate the line where `startDrag`, `endDrag`, and `isDragging` are destructured from `useDrag()`.
    *   Remove `startDrag` and `endDrag` from the destructuring, leaving only `isDragging` (as `isDragging` is still used for styling).

**Verification Steps:**
1.  **Run ESLint:** Execute your project's ESLint command (e.g., `npm run lint` or `eslint src/components/SpotifySearchModal.tsx`).
2.  **Confirm No Warnings:** Ensure the warnings for `startDrag` and `endDrag` are resolved.

**Deliverable:**
Provide the modified code for `src/components/SpotifySearchModal.tsx`.
